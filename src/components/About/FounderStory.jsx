I spent the entire January looking for food vendors to deliver food to me, but the available food delivery providers didn’t deliver during public holidays. I eventually found one after so many hours and ended up paying 4x the regular amount.

No one comes close locally, and it didn’t make sense that at such a small scale, we Africans couldn’t figure it out.
